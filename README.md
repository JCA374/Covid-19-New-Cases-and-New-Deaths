# Covid-19-New-Cases-and-New-Deaths
The jupyter nootbok script collects data from OurWorldInData.org and displays the trends of new cases and new deaths for selected countries.

The data sourses can be found here https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data.
At the moment (2020-03-18) is seams to be missing a few data points for USA and a few other countries.

The data is then displayed (and saved) as a four day moving average to detect trend with the daily cases as bar charts in the background. 

I'm a beginner and this is my first upload so some positive criticism would be welcome.
