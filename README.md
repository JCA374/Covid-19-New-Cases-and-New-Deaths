# Covid-19-New-Cases-and-New-Deaths
The jupyter nootbok script collects data from OurWorldInData.org and displays the trends of new cases and new deaths for selected countries.

The data comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The data is then displayed (and saved) as a four day moving average to detect trend with the daily cases as bar charts in the background. 

I'm a beginner and this is my first upload so some positive criticism would be welcome.
